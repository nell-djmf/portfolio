Waypoint is an app that chronicles your own Hero's Journey, built using PostgreSQL/Express/React/Node, JWT for auth, deployed on Heroku. I really wanted to implement a React component library for this project and used Material UI for some of the forms, buttons, and icons. The concept of a goal tracking RPG seemed simple enough, but I soon found that smart database structure would have made my life much easier. There was a lot of back and forth with my associations, and I must have rebuilt the database at least 5 times over. Diving into Material UI was very exciting, even though I kept the parts I used to a minimum. It really made me appreciate how deep the library was, and how much faster I could create sites using their pre-built components.
