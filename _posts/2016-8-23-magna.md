A group project where I collaborated with my team to build an anime database with a built-in music player, utilizing a PostgreSQL/Express/React/Node, JWT for auth, and deployed on Heroku. I was in charge of the front-end components and logic. I had a lot of fun building this, especially the music player. It was my first time using the ref hook, and also my first time attempting a music player in general. The seek functionality was tricky, especially when I was attempting to set the max duration of the input range bar to the duration of the music track. It took a lot of experimentation with the useEffects and timer intervals, but it was well worth it in the end.
