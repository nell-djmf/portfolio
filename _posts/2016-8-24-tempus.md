This project was my attempt at a mechanical keyboard builder, built with MongoDB/Express/Node/React. This project is what made me appreciate the context hook. At the time, we hadn't covered context in class and I was having issues passing the part id's as props, since my components were nested 3 layers deep. I eventually devised a workaround with localStorage to meet my deadline. Overall, I really enjoyed the project, and was able to experiment with a lot of hover effects and background gradients for styling.
