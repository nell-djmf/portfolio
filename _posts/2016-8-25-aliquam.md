This was my very first project: A dungeon crawler for trivia fans, built with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, deployed on Surge. I used the Trivia API from Open Trivia Database to fetch questions and was inspired by the dark aesthetics of the game Darkest Dungeon. I had a vision of a class-based trivia game, where player abilities could act as life lines to ease the difficulty of questions. This was also a learning experience for class constructors in JS. Overally, I have a soft spot in my heart for this project, even with how simple it is.
