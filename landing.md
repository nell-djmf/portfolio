				<p>"Nell is single-handedly one of the most fascinating software engineers I have ver met. Her outstanding design eye, implementation of tough concepts into her applications, and thirst for new knowledge set her apart from the run-of-the-mill engineer. 
				<br />
				There is not a doubt in my mind that whoever has Nell on their team will never see the shadow of doubt for that decision. Unfortunately, the English language does not allow for enough accurate adjectives to describe Nell's skill. I hope, in time, her actions can more than prove that my words are but the tip of the iceberg that is Nell's phenomenal ability."</p>

			<h2>Dreams into Reality</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I've put in 6 years in the healthcare industry. It was exhausting, pitiless work, and it changed me, inside and out. When the pandemic hit, I found my old facility shut down due to lack of admissions, and suddenly, a lot of time to really think about what I wanted out of my life. A close friend of mine is a software dev; we share a mutual love of online games to cool down after a long day. She suggested I take a look at some coding courses to see if it would be something I’d be interested in. From the first lesson on freecodecamp, I was hooked. I’d always fostered a creative streak, and even fancied myself a future in art or design when I was younger. 
		<br />
		<br />
		Coding allowed me to express my ideas and passions in a format that anyone could interact with. It didn’t have to be a 2D rendering of a specific experience or concept, it could be real. The entire process of planning, coding,  problem-solving, styling, and testing a fully functional app or site lit a fire in me that I had never felt for anything else. It wasn’t just creativity from a stylistic point of view - coding allowed me to be creative with my solutions, with how information was structured, and with how the entire user experience would play out. It was difficult, and there were many, many, late nights. It never felt like work, not once. Finally, I understood what being ‘finding your passion’ meant. 
	<br />
	<br />
	After a whirlwind of bootcamp classes and personal projects, I find myself nervous about translating my passion into being a work-ready candidate. I know that as far as soft skills and overall character, I have a lot to bring. The years in the healthcare industry made me self-sufficient, resourceful, and a quick study. I’m diligent, meticulous, and am a strong believer of the concept ‘the devil is in the details.’ I’m comfortable with leadership, am a strong team player, and like to believe that I am articulate and communicate well. Personally, I feel like I have a lot left to learn. The more I find out, the more questions I have. But that’s the beauty of it, the real joy is in the discovery. 
	<br />
	<br />
	Delving into this world has been simultaneously the most challenging, and the most rewarding experience of my life. Looking at code in the early days used to feel like trying to decipher another language (which it was). And just like learning a new language, the more I learn, the more I appreciate the nuance and personality of the writer. Among all the brackets, conditions, and loops, you can discern an artistry that I thought was only possible in traditional mediums. I’d like to think that somewhere, floating in the depths of cyberspace, someone will discover my own artistry - even the clumsy, bloated projects from when I first tried my hand at making something. They might say “wow, this is awful” or even “wow, how did that even work?” But in the end, it was me! I contributed something to the broad tapestry of this industry, no matter how small. And one day, when I’m older, wiser, and maybe have a higher reputation on Stack Overflow, I can create something that warrants a simple “wow.”</p>
