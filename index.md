Iâ€™m a former nurse who discovered a passion for coding! I started working right at the transition from analog to digital medical records, and the experience has steered my approach to web design and engineering to a holistic one - apps that are easy to understand and are a joy to interact with. My motivators are a passion for design and art in general. I love the entire process of turning a vision into a tangible, usable reality. I value minimalism, iconic imagery, and an organic feel to website design. Code-wise, I strive for readability, efficiency, and reusability. Most of all, my main drive is to learn and experience as much as possible, and contribute even a single thread to the vast tapestry of this industry.

Jumping into the world of coding has been simultaneously the most challenging and rewarding experience in my entire life. Struggling with the need for creative expression, finding a passion for coding was a welcome surprise. As a nurse, I was a quick study, comfortable with leadership, and considered self-sufficiency to be my greatest strength. As a developer, these traits continue to empower me wherever my career path happens to lead.
