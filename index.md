# Some Things About Me

My desired role is a front-end dev creating functional, beautiful, and intuitive apps. After working for most of my professional life in healthcare, I’ve seen first-hand how tools available to the general public and healthcare staff can be cold, clinical and impersonal. It can alienate patients from taking an active role in their own health. It makes for a tedious workflow as well as over-complicating the responsibilities of healthcare providers. 

My approach to web design and engineering are from a holistic standpoint - apps that are easy to understand and flow well enough to not need to google where the settings are. I want to create things that are a joy to interact with, and feel natural to use. My motivators are a passion for design and art in general. I love the entire process of bringing a vision to life with my own hands, even better if it’s usable. I value minimalism, iconic imagery, and an organic feel to website design. Code-wise, I strive for readability, efficiency, and reusability. 

Jumping into the world of coding has been simultaneously the most challenging and rewarding experience in my entire life. Struggling with the need for creative expression, finding a passion for coding was a welcome surprise. As a nurse, I was a quick study, comfortable with leadership, and considered self-sufficiency to be my greatest strength. As a developer, these traits continue to empower me wherever my career path happens to lead.
